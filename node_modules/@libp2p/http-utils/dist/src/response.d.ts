 * Extends the native Response class to be more flexible.
 *
 * - response headers - the fetch spec restricts access to certain headers that
 * we need access to `set-cookie`, `Access-Control-*`, etc, and the native
 * Response implementations remove them
 *
 * - status codes - we need to represent all possible HTTP status codes, not
 * just those allowed by the fetch spec
