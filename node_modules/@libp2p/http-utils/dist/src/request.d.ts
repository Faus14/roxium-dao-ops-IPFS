/**
 * Extends the native Request class to be more flexible.
 *
 * - body - normally GET requests cannot have a body, but if the request is for
 * a WebSocket upgrade, we need the body to turn into the socket
 *
 * Also firefox Web Workers remove the request body though weirdly the main
 * thread doesn't.
 *
 * - headers - the global browser request removes certain headers like
 * Authorization and Sec-WebSocket-Protocol but we need to preserve them
