/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * This module allows you to use HTTP requests as a transport for libp2p
 * protocols (libp2p over HTTP), and also libp2p streams as a transport for HTTP
 * requests (HTTP over libp2p).
 *
 * It integrates with existing Node.js friendly HTTP frameworks such as
 * [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Fastify](https://fastify.dev) as well
 * as [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request)/
 * [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response)-based
 * frameworks like [Hono](https://hono.dev/).
 *
 * It even allows creating Node.js-style [http.Server](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserver)s
 * and [WebSocketServer](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/HEAD/doc/ws.md#class-websocketserver)s
 * in browsers to truly realize the power of the distributed web.
 *
 * In addition to URL-based addressing, it can use a libp2p PeerId and/or
 * multiaddr(s) and lets libp2p take care of the routing, thus taking advantage
 * of features like multi-routes, NAT traversal and stream multiplexing over a
 * single connection.
 *
 * Check out the [examples](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-http/tree/main/examples)
 * for how you can use this in your applications!
